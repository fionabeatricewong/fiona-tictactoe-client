# TicTacToe

This application allows the user to play TicTacToe against themselves (or with someone next to you). This was done as my first project at General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. The specs for this application was given by the instructors.

## Planning Story
Before actually starting this project, I planned to follow the given suggested schedule so that I would have a checklist and steps to follow and an idea on where to start and where to go next. There was a lot we learned before this project - instead of reviewing *all* of the material before starting, I felt it would be better to approach each step, look at the tools I have, and then review what was necessary and do some research to build that particular feature of the TicTacToe game. I also wanted to make a branch for each bolded step (Authentication, API Round 1 (CREATE), Game UI Round 1, etc) to keep organized. However, as I went through the project, it became more difficult to strictly separate certain features/steps because they overlapped and intertwined with each other.

I found it helpful to write pseudocode to set up a sort of skeleton for my code, help me get through writer's block, and problem solve. The game logic definitely took me a long time to translate from plain English into working code. For the game logic and other parts where I was stuck, I had to draw/write things out on paper, use Google, and talked aloud to myself. I had to give myself breaks too, so I could come back to my work with refreshed and rested eyes.

### User stories

- As a user, I want to sign up and log in.
- As a user, I want to know how many games I've played in total.
- As a user, I want to be able to play again when the game is over.
- As a user, I want to know the results of the game.
- As a user, I want to select only the available spaces remaining on the board.
- As a user, I want to put down 'x' and 'o' on the board.

### Technologies Used

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- Ajax
- Sass
- Bootstrap

### Unsolved Problems

I believe I have met the requirements for this project, but I still need to work on the CSS/SCSS to make the website look cleaner, more organized, and pleasing to look at.

Eventually, I would like to allow the user to choose/change the 'x' and the 'o' to letters/characters they want. I would also like to give the user an option for board dimensions (3x3, 4x4, etc).
